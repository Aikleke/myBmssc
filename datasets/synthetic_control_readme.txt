Data Characteristics

This dataset contains 600 examples of control charts synthetically generated by the process in Alcock and Manolopoulos (1999). There are six different classes of control charts:

    Normal
    Cyclic
    Increasing trend
    Decreasing trend
    Upward shift
    Downward shift

Data Format
The data is stored in an ASCII file, 600 rows, 60 columns, with a single chart per line. The classes are organized as follows:

1-100   Normal
101-200 Cyclic
201-300 Increasing trend
301-400 Decreasing trend
401-500 Upward shift
501-600 Downward shift
