Data Set Information:

-- The users' knowledge class were classified by the authors
using intuitive knowledge classifier (a hybrid ML technique of k-NN and meta-heuristic exploring methods), k-nearest neighbor algorithm.
See article for more details on how the users' data was collected and evaluated by the user modeling server.
